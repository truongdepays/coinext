 * Utility methods for Ellipic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) shared secret generation
 *
 * > Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) is a key agreement protocol that allows two parties, each having an
 * > elliptic-curve public–private key pair, to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.
 * > This shared secret may be directly used as a key, or to derive another key. The key, or the derived key, can then
 * > be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric-key cipher. It is a variant of the Diffie–Hellman
 * > protocol using elliptic-curve cryptography.
